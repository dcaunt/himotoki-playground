# Himotoki Playground

A playground tutorial for the Swift JSON decoding library [Himotoki](https://github.com/ikesyo/Himotoki). This playground accompanies the blog post I wrote [here](http://davidcaunt.co.uk/himotoki-tutorial). The current version of this playground supports Xcode 8/Swift 3.0.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository
-  Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` in the root of the repository to fetch Himotoki
-  Open `Himotoki-playground.xcworkspace`  (_not the playground_)
-  Build the `Himotoki-iOS` scheme. 
-  Run the Playground.
